    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I craft precision models, blending efficiency with optimized FLOPS.

I am a seasoned engineer at Intel Corporation with 5 years of invaluable experience. During my early tenure at Intel, I successfully crafted an end-to-end scalable production data pipeline on AWS. My primary focus was on ensuring data integrity, consistency, and transformation, resulting in a system catering to 10+ downstream internal and external customers, receiving over 30 million hits monthly.  

üåê Open Source Contributions:
As an open-source enthusiast, I contribute to the Linux Foundation project, Secure Federated AI OpenFL. Notably, I implemented an efficient federation component timeout feature, enhancing the project's functionality. Additionally, I introduced JAX (FLAX) Cifar10 and linear regression-based federated learning examples, showcasing my commitment to advancing federated learning frameworks.
